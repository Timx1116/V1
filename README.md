I've made a website in html with the use of CSS styling. This website is a lexicon of different birds and it links to multiple html documents as well as wikipedia. A CSS style sheet has been made to style the website. We have a drop down menu in nav which you can use to go to the different bird's sites. Screenshots of the website's main page, or index.html can be seen down below:

The image and the name of the bird are linked to an individual site with information about the bird. The following screenshots is an example of one of the birds, the Bald Eagle:
