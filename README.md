I've made a website in html with the use of some CSS styling. This website is a lexicon of different birds and it links to multiple html documents as well as wikipedia. A screenshot of the website can be seen down below:

The image and the name of the bird is linked to an individual site with information about the bird. The following screenshot is an example of one of the birds, the Bald Eagle:

All the html documents have bookmarks that lead to two different articles. The first one contains all the flying birds, and the second contains the flightless ones:
