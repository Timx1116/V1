I've made a website in html with the use of CSS styling. This website is a lexicon of different birds and it links to multiple html documents as well as wikipedia. A CSS file has been made to style the website. We have a drop down menu in nav which you can use to go to the different bird's sites and the menu is sticky so it follows as you scroll down. Screenshots of the website's main page, or index.html can be seen down below:

A picture of the dropdown menu can be seen below. If you click on "Flying Birds" it takes you to the flying birds section of the front page, however you can also open a birds page by clicking it in the dropdown menu:

The image and the name of the bird are linked to an individual site with information about the bird. The following screenshots is an example of one of the birds, the Bald Eagle:
